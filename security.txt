security.txt file that describes the approach you used to securely store user passwords.

During signup, the raw password is hashed using BCryptPasswordEncoder from the spring-security-crypto library and the resulting hash is stored in the password_hash column of the user table.
During login, the application retrieves the stored hash and uses BCryptPasswordEncoder.matches() to verify the submitted password. 
The plaintext password is not stored in the database.
